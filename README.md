# processing-dark-theme
A dark theme for processing 3+

I did NOT create this from scratch. I modified this https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_3.0 and added a preferences.txt file to modify syntax highlight colors.

# install

  WINDOWS
  - [THEME] Go to the folder where you have processing installed, and drag the contents from the theme folder into the lib folder.
  - [PREFERENCES] Go to %appdata%/processing and drag the contents from the preferences folder into there.

  MACOS
  - [THEME] Right click the processing app, and press 'show package contents' and drag the items from the theme folder into java/lib
  - [PREFERENCES] Open terminal and type "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES". This will allow you to see hidden files. Next, go to /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Processing and drag all the contenxts from the preferences folder into it. To disable hidden files, run "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO" in terminal.
